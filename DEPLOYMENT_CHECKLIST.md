# Railway Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Files Required
- [ ] `docusearch_new.py` - Main application
- [ ] `create_embeddings.py` - Embedding utilities
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- [ ] `Procfile` - Railway configuration
- [ ] `railway.json` - Railway settings
- [ ] `.dockerignore` - Build optimization
- [ ] `start.sh` - Startup script
- [ ] `deploy_railway.py` - Validation script

### Data Files
- [ ] `embeddings/embeddings.json` - Embeddings data
- [ ] `extracted_content/` - Document content
- [ ] `connections/` - Connection data (if needed)

### Environment Setup
- [ ] OpenAI API key ready
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] All files committed to Git

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Validate Setup
```bash
python deploy_railway.py
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
#### Option A: GitHub Integration
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect Railway to GitHub repository
3. Railway will auto-deploy

#### Option B: CLI Deployment
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 3. Configure Environment
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Set your OpenAI API key value

### 4. Monitor Deployment
1. Check Railway logs
2. Verify health checks pass
3. Test the application URL

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment

### Testing
- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Search functionality works
- [ ] Chat functionality works (with API key)
- [ ] File downloads work
- [ ] All modes (Search, Chat, Documents) work

### Optimization
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Check response times
- [ ] Optimize if needed
- [ ] Set up monitoring

### Security
- [ ] API key is secure
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Rate limiting considered
- [ ] Error handling in place

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- [ ] Check deployment status
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] View application logs
- [ ] Set up alerts if needed

### Application Health
- [ ] Regular health checks
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] User feedback collection

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check requirements.txt and dependencies
2. **Memory Issues**: Consider upgrading Railway plan
3. **API Errors**: Verify OpenAI API key and credits
4. **File Not Found**: Ensure data files are included in deployment
